### 🎨 Customize your bedsheets with any banner design! Make your bed stand out!
It's very easy to put banners on beds with this datapack installed!

Just crouch and place the banner at the end of the bed and it will be placed on for you!

To remove the bedsheet, break the bed!

### ❌UNINSTALLATION:
If you don't end up liking the pack here are the ways you can remove it:

manually breaking each bed with a bedsheet
writing /function bannerbedsheets:removeall (you wont get your banners back though)
If you already removed the pack then run this command, but you won't get your banners back:

/execute at @e run kill @e[​type=minecraft:item_display,tag=bedsheet]
